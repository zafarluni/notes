# Git Low Level Commands  

- git hash-object  
- git cat-file  
- git mktree  

### Git cat-file

Provide content or type and size information for repository objects
Flags: -p to print contects, -s to print size and -t for type of object

e.g: 
```ps
git cat-file -p b7aec520dec0a7516c18eb4c68b64ae1eb9b5a5eob
```

Git doesn't store object based on their name. Instead it uses it's hash calculated as:


> ***Git Object Name => Git Object Hash = Content + Object Type + Object Length = Hash***

Example:   
```ps
Hello, Git => Blob 11\0Hello, Git
```

```ps
$ echo "blob 11\0Hello, Git" | shasum
5fa6d9c54f3d2c4b6bb2b0e6ed71059a84fa7463  
```

*To tell Git that __\0__ should be interpreted as null escape character (if you are getting different sha) add __-e__*

```ps
$ echo -e "blob 11\0Hello, Git" | shasum  
b7aec520dec0a7516c18eb4c68b64ae1eb9b5a5e  
```

It is Same as generated by git hash-object  

```ps
$ echo -e "blob 30\0Second file in Git repository" | shasum  
4400aae52a27341314f423095846b1f215a7cf08
```

### Git hash-object
$ echo "Second file in Git repository" | git hash-object --stdin
4400aae52a27341314f423095846b1f215a7cf08



# Git Permission types
| Binary | Octal | Meaning |
| ------ | ----- |-------------|
|0100000000000000|(040000)| Directory|  
|1000000110100100|(100644)| Regular non-executable file|  
|1000000110110100| (100664)| Regular non-executable group-writeable file|
|1000000111101101| (100755)| Regular executable file|
|1010000000000000| (120000)| Symbolic link|
|1110000000000000| (160000)| Gitlink|



# Git Object Types

```
- Blob -> All types of files are stored as Blob 
- Tree -> Information about Directories
- Commit -> Allows to store different versions of files of project
- Annotated Tag -> Persistant text pointer to a specifi commit
```

### Blob

Creating blobs from text:  

```ps
$echo "Hello, Git" | git hash-object --stdin -w   (-w to write object to file system)  
$b7aec520dec0a7516c18eb4c68b64ae1eb9b5a5e  
```

Creating blobs from files:

To write file:
```ps
$ git hash-object filename -w
```

This will create fiel object inside .git-> objects -> b7 (starting 2 characters of Hashcode)

> *Git always reuses same save hash code for files with exactly same content.*

### Tree
 A *"tree"* in Git is an object (a file, really) which contains a list of pointers to blobs or other trees.  Each line in the tree object's file contains:   
***mode/permissions, the type, the hash, and the file name***  
e.g 
```ps
  $ git cat-file -p ef34a15  
  100644 blob 3b18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad    readme.md
```


Creating a Git Tree Object:

We have two files now in Git objects. We can view them as:

```ps
$ find objects/ -type f
```

- Annotated Tag -> Persistant text pointer to a specifi commit

```


Creating a Git Tree Object:

We have two files now in Git objects. We can view them as:

```ps
$ find objects/ -type f
objecUsing ts/44/00aae52a27341314f423095846b1f215a7cf08
objects/b7/aec520dec0a7516c18eb4c68b64ae1eb9b5a5e
```

We will create file for them and from that file we will make Git Tree Object.

Create a file with following contents:
```
100644 blob b7aec520dec0a7516c18eb4c68b64ae1eb9b5a5e    file1.txt
100644 blob 4400aae52a27341314f423095846b1f215a7cf08    file2.txt
```

*Important: Only use tab between hash and file name space will not work.
We will name it temp-tree.txt.*

To create git Tree Object:

```ps
$ cat /d/temp-tree.txt | git mktree
3b95df0ac6365c72e9b0ff6c449645c87e6e1159

$ git cat-file -t 3b95
tree
```

To Move Files from Repository into Stagging Area:

```ps
$ git read-tree 3b95
```

To read contents of stagging area:
```ps
$ git ls-files
file1.txt
file2.txt

$ git ls-files -s
100644 b7aec520dec0a7516c18eb4c68b64ae1eb9b5a5e 0       file1.txt
100644 4400aae52a27341314f423095846b1f215a7cf08 0       file2.txt

```

*0 represented after hash code shows file in stagging area as exactly same as one in repository and there are no changes.*


To Move File to Working Area From Stagging:

```ps
$ git checkout-index -a
```
*__-a__ flag is used to checkout all files*

### Commit
Commits help us to store different versions/snapshots of our projects. Commit has same structre as blob and tree. A commit is simply a wraper around a tree object. A commit has following details:

> Author name and email, commit description, Parent, pointer to a tree object

Like any other git object every commit has its own sha-1 hash. 

 ```ps
 $ git cat-file -p 4bf4
tree 3b95df0ac6365c72e9b0ff6c449645c87e6e1159
author Luni <author@email.com> 1654080996 +0300
committer Luni <author@email.com> 1654080996 +0300

first commit

 ```

The -a parameter on commit says to add all changes of tracked files and commit them. So

```ps
git commit -a
```

will not commit a new file you created. You must explicitly add this.

To selectively add files, use the patch modifier on git add:

```ps
git add -i
```


The -m parameter allows you to avoid opening the editor to edit your commit message and use what you put in following the -m option:

```ps
git commit -m "Use this message and don't open the editor"
```

Combining -am will add and commit all tracked files.

```ps
git commit -am "Use all track files add this message and don't open the editor"
```



Annotated Tag
==============
TBD

Git Pack Files
==============

Git compresses git objects into .pack files to reduce side. Inside the objects/pac folder .pac file contain compressed git object and .idx is an index file. To unpack the "pac" file we use:

```ps
$ cat pack-7949a9d193abdae7030ba6982475084d744861e3.pack | git unpack-objects
Unpacking objects: 100% (406/406), done.
```

# Merging

## Fast-Forward Merge

Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch (ie there are no changes in master since feature branch has been created) In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.

```ps
git merge feature-branch
```

# Remote Reporsitories

Default name of Remote branch is **origin**.

To list remote repositories

```ps
git remote
```

For details for pull and fetch targets:

```ps
git remote
```
To list only remote branches:

```ps
git branch -r
```

To list all local and remote branches:

```ps
git branch -a
```

## Tracking Branches

Tracking branch is your local branch that is connected to specific remoter branch. By defautl when you clone any remote repository git creates one tracking branch and name of this branch match name of **default** branch in remote repository.

To list your tracking branches:

```ps
git branch -vv
```
